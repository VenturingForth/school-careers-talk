# Careers Week Talk

## Slides
You will find slides in the `_slides` folder in both PPT and PDF format. Please update these each time you deliver this talk and leave notes of any changes you make.

## Live Coding
You will also find a coding exercise for a dice rolling game to live code with students in five to ten minutes. You also have the final solution to hand if you need a refresher, or you don't have time to run the entire live code exercise.
